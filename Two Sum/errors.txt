1、This is the first time that I use C++ to code.So I don't know how to use  vector in c++.This is the first question.
2、When I tried to solve the problem,I didn't recognize the description,so that I define a plus 2 as a when it fails to get target.
3、I didn't consider that it need two for loops to sovle it.
